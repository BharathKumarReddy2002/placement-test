The given code has one issue: It is missing the initial value for the accumulator in the reduce method. To fix this, we need to provide an initial value as an object with evens and odds properties to the reduce method.

//
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { evens: [], odds: [] });

console.log(result);
//

output:
{ evens: [ 2, 4 ], odds: [ 1, 3, 5 ] }
